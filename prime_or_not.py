# This is a program to find out if the user input number is prime or not
# The task is to accomplish the task by using functions

# The following functions are envisaged:
# 1. Function to get input from user and pass it to prime calculation fn.
# 2. Function to verify if its argument is a prime number or not
# 3. Function to print the result- either as prime or not prime



# def get_input():
#     return int(input("Enter a number ")
# 
# def even_or_not():
#     print ("OMG!")
#     if get_input() % 2 == 0:
#        return "Even"
